# ABSTRACT

In the Scotian Shelf Ecosystem (SSE), Snow Crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*) has been a dominant macro-invertebrate since the decline of the groundfish in the 1990s. They are mostly observed in deep, soft-bottom substrates ranging from 60 to 300 m and at temperatures generally less than 6${}^\circ$ C. The SSE Snow Crab are in the southern-most extreme of their spatial distribution in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and vulnerable to climate variability. 

The assessment of 4VWX Snow Crab status (TOR #1; see Terms of reference, below) is based on fishery independent surveys with a focus upon indicators of abundance, reproductive potential, recruitment, and exploitation rates (TOR #2). Robust, Bayesian, Hurdle-type spatiotemporal models are used to incorporate habitat viability attributable to ecosystem influences (depth, species composition and bottom temperature variations, etc.) and so account for biases due to deficiencies of sample design and incomplete surveys. Models of fishery dynamics are used to infer historical abundance and a new model for forward projections is used to help evaluate the consequences of different harvest levels (TOR #3). Further, we highlight some of the bycatch in the survey that highlights potentially elevated predation-related mortality in some areas (TOR #4).  

Commercial catch rates and other fishery statistics are reported. Overall, fishing effort was much reduced in 2022, especially in S-ENS and 4X. TACs were mostly caught, with the exception of 4X. Catch rates were at or near all-time highs in all areas, except for 4X. At-Sea-Observed information was sparse and so fishery bycatch and snow crab size distributions were not evaluated.

Survey indices suggest a downtrend in numerical densities of Snow Crab recruiting to fishable sizes, especially in N-ENS. Similarly, declines in numerical densities of mature females, especially in N-ENS, suggest potential declines in egg production and long term recruitment. Mature snow crab sex ratios remain close to balanced levels, except again in N-ENS. Crude geometric mean biomass densities of the fishable component have also declined in all areas, and for S-ENS and 4X, it was at an historical low. Adjustment by spacetime index modelling suggest that the biomass index is also low, but habitat variability, especially as they relate to bottom temperature variability was very significant. 

Modelled inference (Model 1) closely follows the biomass index and suggests that the overall biomass of fishable Snow Crab has marginally declined over the last year and that fishing mortality has declined and are well below FMSY, with the exception of N-ENS. Model 1 places N- and S-ENS in the "healthy" zone and 4X in the "cautious" zone. Supplemental analysis using a more complex model (Model 2) supports these inferences. However, they suggest that Model 1's estimates of carrying capacity may be overly optimistic and as such fishing mortality estimates may be biased low. Fishery footprint, a sensitive index of how much a fishery activity is altering the dynamics of a population, is inferred to be lower than 50% in all areas. Assuming current ecosystem conditions persist, Model 2 suggest that a status quo TAC for 2023 would likely result in reductions in overall abundance and that the fishery footprint would go above 50% in N-ENS, upto 40% in S-ENS and in 4X. All regions have flexibility. However, due to a lower level of recruitment in N-ENS and potentially elevated predation mortality, care should be taken in 2023 until recruitment returns.


# SUMMARY


- Fishing effort in `r year.assessment` were `r e_nens` $\times 10^3$ trap hauls in N-ENS, `r e_sens` $\times 10^3$ trap hauls in S-ENS and  `r e_4x` $\times 10^3$ trap hauls in 4X. This represents a  change of `r dt_e_nens` %, `r dt_e_sens` % and  `r dt_e_4x` %, respectively, relative to the previous year. 

- Landings in `r year.assessment` were `r l_nens` t in N-ENS; `r l_sens` t in S-ENS; and `r l_4x` t in CFA 4X (season ongoing), representing a change of `r dt_l_nens`%, `r dt_l_sens`% and  `r dt_l_4x`%, respectively, relative to `r year_previous`. Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for `r year.assessment` were `r tac_nens` t, `r tac_sens` t and `r tac_4x` t in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively. 

- Non-standardized fishery catch rates in `r year.assessment` were `r c_nens`, `r c_sens`  and `r c_4x` kg/trap haul in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively. This represents a change of respectively, `r dt_c_nens` %, `r dt_c_sens` % and  `r dt_c_4x` % (season ongoing) relative to the previous year. Though the spatial extent of exploitation was smaller, many of the exploited area show elevated catch rates.

- Commercial catches of soft-shelled (newly moulted) Snow Crab for `r year.assessment` were `r cc_soft_nens`%, `r cc_soft_sens`% and `r cc_soft_4x`%, respectively, in N-ENS S-ENS and 4X (season ongoing). In `r year_previous`, it was `r cc_soft_nens_p`%, `r cc_soft_sens_p`% and `r cc_soft_4x_p`%, respectively. Sensecent (CC5) crab levels were higher in N- and S-ENS than in previous years, though low and inconsistent sampling effort makes this uncertain.

- Bycatch of non-target species is low (<< 1% of total catch) in all Snow Crab fishing areas; however, the last reliable estimate comes from 2017. 

- Little to no recruitment is expected for the next 1-3 years in N-ENS. In S-ENS, continued moderate levels of recruitment are expected. In 4X, low to moderate levels of recruitment are expected for 2 years. Egg and larval production is expected to be high in the next year in all areas except N-ENS. 

- In N-ENS, the modelled biomass (pre-fishery) of Snow Crab in `r year.assessment` was `r round(B_north[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_north[t1], 2)` t in `r year_previous`. In S-ENS, the modelled biomass (pre-fishery) was `r round(B_south[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_south[t1], 2)` t in `r year_previous`. In 4X, the `r year.assessment`-`r year.assessment+1` season's modelled biomass (pre-fishery) was `r round(B_4x[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_4x[t1], 2)` t in the `r year_previous`-`r year.assessment` season. 

- Average bottom temperatures observed in the 2022 Snow Crab survey were near or above historical highs in all areas. Average viable habitat surface area has declined to historical lows in 2022.

- Based on stomach sampling, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Wolffish, Thorny Skate, and other skate species appear to be the predominant predators of Snow Crab on the Scotian Shelf. Overall, higher predation mortality seems likely in N- and S-ENS and lower in 4X. Co-occurring species such as shrimp densities have declined, possibly due to large-scaled environmental change.

- In N-ENS, though recruitment continues at low levels, a gap in future recruitment to the fishery is expected for the next 1-3 years in N-ENS. N-ENS still exists in the healthy zone and so still has flexibility in approach. However, fishing mortality may have been higher than desirable. A more conservative harvest strategy would enable bridging this coming recruitment gap. A reduced TAC is prudent. 

- In S-ENS, recruitment to the fishery is likely to continue at a moderate rate for the upcoming season. The S-ENS stock remains in the healthy zone. Exploitation rates derived from the fishery model have been declining in recent years. S-ENS has considerable flexibility in approach. All TAC directions are viable. 

- In 4X, low to moderate levels of recruitment are expected for 2 years. 4X exists in the "cautious zone". The area is also in the southern-most extent of Snow Crab distribution in the North Atlantic and viable habitat has been depressed for many years. A reduced TAC is prudent. 




# BACKGROUND

## Terms of Reference (TOR)

To provide an assessment of the:

  1. status of Snow Crabs
  2. relative abundance and exploitation rates
  3. evaluate consequences of different harvest levels upon abundance and exploitation rates
  4. bycatch in survey


Amendments of the Fisheries Act in 2022 (*Fish Stock Provisions*), have encoded management approaches and requirements relative to biological reference points. In the SSE Snow Crab Fishery, these biological reference points were originally defined heuristically with a  *phenomenological* model (a descriptive, model without mechanism, herein "Model 1"; Choi 2023), with all participants to the management process being aware that it was simplistic at best and that it served as supplemental information to help provide context rather than be the tool used for management. As there is now a strong legal requirement that such reference points become a primary management tool, there is a need to define these reference point with greater care and evaluate their robustness and utility with other models. Here, we will provide some additional information towards this goal and present "Model 2" results (see Ecosystem considerations, below and Choi 2023), in order to obtain more context around the reference points and status (objectives 2 and 3 of the Terms of Reference).


## Ecology

Snow Crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*; Figure \@ref(fig:crab-image)) are a circumpolar, subarctic species. In the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, they are found from northern Labrador to near the Gulf of Maine. The Scotian Shelf Ecosystem (SSE) represents the southern-most part of this distribution and so most influenced by environmental variability. In the SSE, habitat preference is generally for soft mud bottoms, at depths from 60 to 300 m and temperatures from -1 to 6${}^\circ$ C. Temperatures greater than 7${}^\circ$ C are known to be metabolically detrimental. Mature females and immature crab are found in slightly more complex habitats with shelter at marginally shallower depths (Choi et al. 2022). Their primary food items show ontogenetic shift. In their bottom dwelling phase, they rely upon: shrimp, fish, starfish, sea urchins, worms, detritus, large zooplankton, other crabs, molluscs, sea snails, and sea anemones. Their predators are primarily humans, Atlantic Halibut, Thorny Skate, Wolfish, Atlantic Cod, seals, American Plaice, squids, and other crabs. Crab in the size range of 3 to 30 mm carapace width (CW) are particularly vulnerable to predation, as are soft-shelled crab in the spring molting season. Cannibalism of immature crab by females have also been observed. More detailed information with regards to snow habitat requirements and spatiotemporal distributions of different life stages in the SSE are presented in Choi et al. (2022).


## Precautionary Approach 

A precautionary approach is a guiding principle for fisheries harvesting in Canada ("Fish Stock Provisions" Amendments of the Fisheries Act, 2022). As such it is worthwhile emphasizing the many existing measures and fishing practices in the SSE Snow Crab fishery that are inherently precautionary that are not always appreciated by the general public:

- **The spawning stock (breeding females)** is  *completely protected*.

- **Conservative exploitation strategies** have generally been the norm since the mid-2000s.

- **Spatial refugia** are associated with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), along the continental slopes, and much of the western inshore portion of CFA 24 and 4X.

- **Temporal refugia** associated with fishing seasons. 

- **Biological refugia** -- most life stages are protected. 

  - No removal of female crab, the "spawning stock". None.

  - Immature and soft-shelled (newly-molted) Snow Crab are easily damaged. They are not harvested, and handling mortality is minimized via spring harvesting, voluntary area closures, and at-sea observer monitoring of soft-shell incidence, helping to maximize the potential yield per animal to the biomass. 

  - Reproductive potential of spawning stock is not disrupted. Most removals of males occur after mating and sub-legal mature crab (able to reproduce) are never removed. Their relative numbers (sex ratios) are monitored.

- **Collaborative management** 

  - Fishers prioritize scientific, fisheries-independent, evidence-based decision making. They participate in temperature monitoring and tagging studies. They also fund directly the majority of the science work required to collect fisheries-independent data through Collaborative Agreements. They fully understand the intrinsic value of the long-term sustainability of Snow Crab and its connection to their own long term socioeconomic success. 
  
  - Fishers have had many years of observational experience and are well informed about the biology and ecology of Snow Crab and associated species. As such, they represent a distributed knowledge network that embodies a great depth of traditional and historical knowledge of the SSE. Their participation in scientific reviews continues to keep them up-to-date with emerging issues and able to be active agents in an **adaptive system** of fishery management.   

  - Management of the fishery was initially based on effort controls (season, license, trap limits) from 1982 to 1993 with harvest occurring from June-November, of hard-shelled males larger than 95 mm Carapace Width (CW). Additional management measures were introduced from 1994 to 1999: Individual Boat Quotas (IBQs), Total Allowable Catches (TACs), Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), 100% dockside monitoring, mandatory logbooks and at-sea monitoring by certified observers and satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); and adoption of biodegradeable mesh to reduce ghost-fishing of lost gear.

  - Spring fishing efforts were voluntarily implemented in N-ENS and S-ENS to avoid soft-shelled  crab handling mortality, in the mid-2000s. The fishery in area 4X having a fall to winter season, spanning calendar years, have managed to avoid unnecessarily soft-shell captures from its inception in the late 1990s. Voluntary measures to land only fully mature crab, easily identified by large-claws were also agreed upon in the late-2000s to increase the longevity of the sexually mature population, and reduce the number of snow crab individuals removed and were based upon conservation and precautionary principles. 



# FISHERY STATISTICS

## Fishing effort

Fishing effort in `r year.assessment` was `r e_nens` $\times 10^3$, `r e_sens` $\times 10^3$ and `r e_4x` $\times 10^3$ trap hauls in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively. Relative to the previous year, these represent changes of `r dt_e_nens` %, `r dt_e_sens` % and  `r dt_e_4x` %, respectively (Tables \@ref(tab:table-fishery-nens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-sens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-4x), Figure \@ref(fig:effort-timeseries)). Fishing effort was consistent between `r year.assessment` and `r year_previous` in terms of  spatial distribution. In S-ENS, there was, however, a minor spatial contraction to inshore areas and away from the area 23-24 boundary (Figure \@ref(fig:effort-map)). This is presumed to be related to, in part, warm water incursions into the area (see Ecosystem considerations, below).


## Fishery landings and TACs

Landings across time are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:landings-timeseries). In `r year.assessment`, they were `r l_nens`, `r l_sens` and `r l_4x` t, in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X (season ongoing), respectively. Relative to `r year_previous`, they represent changes of `r dt_l_nens`%, `r dt_l_sens`% and  `r dt_l_4x`%, respectively (Tables \@ref(tab:table-fishery-nens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-sens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-4x)). Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for `r year.assessment` were `r tac_nens` t, `r tac_sens` t and `r tac_4x` t in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively. 


Additional carry forward allowance was implemented by DFO Fisheries Management of up to 25% of the 2020 quota to the 2021 season for N-ENS and S-ENS Snow Crab fishery. These were a response to COVID-19 related uncertainties with safe fishing activity. The carry-forward amounts were: 11.2 t in N-ENS, and 217.4 t in S-ENS (Tables \@ref(tab:table-fishery-nens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-sens)). In 2022, landings in all areas were below respective TACs.
 

The landings in N-ENS for 2022 and 2021 were similar in their spatial patterns (Figure \@ref(fig:sse-map)). In S-ENS, landings, as with fishing effort, shifted slightly inshore and away from the area 23-24 boundary (Figure \@ref(fig:landings-map)). There were no landings on the continental slope areas of S-ENS in 2022 which continues to serve as a "reserve" for Snow Crab from fishing. The landings in 4X for 2022 as with 2021, were primarily in the area just south of Sambro, bordering onto area 24. In N-ENS, most landings occured in the spring. 
  

## Fishery catch rates

Non-standardized fishery catch rates in `r year.assessment` were `r c_nens`, `r c_sens`  and `r c_4x` kg/trap haul in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively. This represents a change of respectively, `r dt_c_nens` %, `r dt_c_sens` % and  `r dt_c_4x` % (season ongoing) relative to the previous year (Tables \@ref(tab:table-fishery-nens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-sens), \@ref(tab:table-fishery-4x), Figures \@ref(fig:cpue-timeseries)). Though the spatial extent of exploitation was smaller, many of the exploited area show elevated catch rates (Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-map)).


## At-Sea-Observed information

Carapace condition of the fished component is determined from At-Sea-Observed catches. In 2021, both N-ENS and 4X were not sampled by At-Sea-Observers. In 2022, 4X was not sampled by At-Sea-Observers. Estimates of carapace condition since 2020 are unreliable as they represent only small areas of the fishing grounds and short time periods relative to the whole fishing season (Figure \@ref(fig:observer-locations-map)). 

In the exploited fraction of Snow Crab, Carapace Condition (CC) is an index of the approximate time since the last molt so describes the relative development and subsequent decay of the carapace. CC1 signifies a newly molted crab, soft-shelled, with no epibiont (e.g., barnacles) growth. CC2 crab have begun to harden, but is still considered to be soft and of no commercial value. CC3 and CC4 represent ideal commercial crab. The oldest carapace condition (CC5) signifies extensive shell decay with no expectation of survival into the next year.

Commercial catches of soft-shelled crab were `r cc_soft_nens`% (low sampling), `r cc_soft_sens`% (low sampling) and `r cc_soft_4x`% (no sampling; season ongoing) in N-ENS, S-ENS and 4X, respectively for `r year.assessment`. In `r year_previous`, it was `r cc_soft_nens_p`% (no sampling), `r cc_soft_sens_p`% (low sampling) and `r cc_soft_4x_p`% (no sampling), respectively. Generally, higher soft-shell indicates incoming recruitment to the fishery and their  handling potential and unnecessary handling/discard mortality.

In 2022, CC5 crab levels were higher in N- and S-ENS than in previous years, though again low and inconsistent sampling effort (space, time aliasing) makes this uncertain.

Bycatch in the Snow Crab fishery is also monitored from the At-Sea-Observed catches. Due to a paupacy of consistent data, very little can be said of bycatch after 2017. Historically, bycatch in the Snow Crab fishery has been minimal (Tables 4, 5) with increasing levels as a function of increasing water temperature: there are higher by catch in warmer conditions, primarily other Crustacea (crab and lobster), especially when viable habitat is low and animals with divergent habitat requirements find themselves next to each other. Low bycatch has been attributed to trap design (top entry conical traps), the large mesh size (5.25 inches, knot to knot) and the passive nature of the gear (Hebert et al., 2001).  

 

# SURVEY INDICES
 
Survey catch rates are confounded by numerous factors that vary across space and time. This is because distributions of Snow Crab and variables that influence these distributions vary across space and time, while survey effort does not (they are mostly fixed stations, in time and space). Survey catch rates depend upon seasonality, bottom temperatures, predator distributions, food availability, reproductive behavior, substrate/shelter availability, relative occurrence of soft and immature crab, species co-occurrence, vessel/captain experience, gear configuration, ambient currents, etc. These factors are taken into account where possible with *CARSTM* (Conditional AutoRegressive SpatioTemporal Models; Choi 2020, Choi et al. 2022; and references therein), a robust extension of Bayesian, Hurdle-type generalized linear random effects models to spatially and temporally connected units.  

The survey was not conducted in 2020 due to Covid-19 related to health and safety uncertainties. In 2022, the survey did not complete due to mechanical issues with the survey vessel. Inshore areas of S-ENS were most affected (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-locations-map)). 


## Size and carapace condtion

Geometric mean size of the mature male component of Snow Crab has varied between 83 to 108 mm CW (Figure \@ref(fig:meansize-male-mat)) in the historical record. Changes in size can be caused by  poor environmental conditions that encourage early maturation, size-selective predation, loss of the largest individuals due to fishing and the start or end of a recruitment pulse. N-ENS and 4X have seen the greatest volatility. S-ENS has been stable. In 2022 it has declined in S-ENS (though this may be an result of incomplete surveys) and 4X (death of the largest crab possibly due to warm water incursions) while increasing in N-ENS (low recruitment).  

The carapace condition of mature male crab captured by the Snow Crab survey are shown in Figure (\@ref(fig:sizefeq-male-survey-cc)). The relative distributions are mostly comparable across time. However, there has been a slight increase in the proportion of CC5 crab in 2022 for S-ENS. An increase was also seen in At-sea-observed fishery data and so could be indicative of accelerated ageing associated with high temperature conditions (see below). However, the incomplete sampling in the inshore areas of S-ENS and in the At-Sea-Observed data makes inference uncertain. 
 

## Recruitment

Quantitative determination of recruitment levels into the fishable component is confounded by a number of factors. These include terminal molt (the timing offset of molting in spring and the survey in the fall), the inability to age crab, the inability to predict the age that male crab will terminally molt and the focus of the survey upon the fishable component which results in a biased under-representation of recruitment. As habitat requirements/preferences of adolescent and larval components are divergent to those of the fishable component (Choi et al 2022), their estimation is challenging. 

Based on size-frequency histograms of the male Snow Crab population, little to no recruitment is expected for the next 1-3 years in N-ENS (Figure \@ref(fig:sizefeq-male)). In S-ENS, continued moderate levels of recruitment are expected. In 4X, low to moderate levels of recruitment are expected for 2 years. 

## Reproduction

In all areas, there was substantial and continued recruitment of female crab into the mature (egg-bearing) segment of the population from 2016-2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:sizefeq-female)). However, in N-ENS for 2022, a decline in numerical densities was observed as well as low densities of adolescent females. Egg and larval production is expected to be moderate to high in the next year in all areas except N-ENS. Mature female abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:fmat-timeseries)) distributions are heterogeneous and often in shallower areas.  

 
## Sex ratios

The sex ratios (proportion female) of the mature component is particularly important as locally unbalanced ratios can impact upon encounter rates and ultimately reproductive success (Figure \@ref(fig:sexratio-mature)). In the ESS, there is generally a lack of females, in contrast to, for example, the Gulf of St-Lawrence where the reverse is often the case. Higher sex ratios are usually found in inshore and bottom slope areas (Figure \@ref(fig:sexratio-map)). A decline in sex ratios has been observed since 2017 in N-ENS (Figure \@ref(fig:sexratio-mature)). In S-ENS the sex ratio increased from 20% in 2021 to just under 35% in 2022. In 4X, mature sex ratios are more balanced and currently near the 50% level.  



## Biomass Density

The fishable component is defined as Snow Crab that are male, mature, and larger than 95 mm CW. The crude **biomass density** (that is, unadjusted, geometric mean fishable per unit swept area by the trawl) of the fishable component, sampled by the Snow Crab survey is shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fbGMTS), and \@ref(fig:fbgeomean-map). A peak in crude biomass density was observed in 2009 to 2014 and has since been declining in all areas. Note that high and low biomass density areas fluctuate with time (Figure \@ref(fig:fbgeomean-map)). Biomass density, however, does not equate to total biomass as the areas occupied by crab can contract, expand and shift with environmental conditions and ecosystem variability. 


## Biomass Index

The fishable **biomass index** is a statistically modelled estimate after adjustment for ecosystem indices and spatiotemporal autocorrelation; Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-map)). More specifically, it was computed using conditional auto-regressive spatio-temporal models (Choi 2020) of probability of observation, numerical abundance of positive valued occurrence and mean size with environmental covariates of depth, substrate, bottom temperature, two axes of species composition ordinations. Further, the biomass index model infers (that is, *imputes*) the spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass density of the fishable component (Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-map)). The locations with no sampling from 2022 are also imputed. Upon aggregation of the solutions, we see that the overall biomass has had several cycles (Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-timeseries)). Note, however, the more elevated uncertainty for the imputed 2020 and partially imputed 2022 estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-timeseries)).

The magnitudes of the biomass index are optimistically high as the spatial expansion uses areal units with large surface areas, larger than the patchiness of Snow Crab distributions (spatial autocorrelation length is <20 km, on average; Choi 2020). As such, it should only be seen as a spatially and temporally comparable relative index of abundance. As the size of areal units decreases to scales smaller than the spatial autocorrelation length, the solutions will converge to reality; but the costs in time and resources of achieving this are prohibitive as sampling intensity required to achieve such a result would require at least another two orders of magnitude increase in sampling effort (in time and space).

The spatial distribution of the biomass index has been consistent over the past six years, with a peak in overall biomass index in 2019 and 2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-map)). Since then, a  reduction was observed throughout the region, with the exception of the core areas. A contraction of spatial range in 4X and the western parts of S-ENS were also evident in 2021 to 2022. Upon aggregation, the biomass index declined marginally in all areas (Figure \@ref(fig:fbindex-timeseries)).


## Modelled Biomass

The biomass index along with fishery removals are used to fit a *Logistic Biomass Dynamics Model* (Model 1; Choi 2023) to determine fishable **modelled biomass** (biomass estimated from the fisheries model; Figure \@ref(fig:logisticPredictions)) and relevant biological reference points (i.e., carrying capacity and fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield, or F~MSY~). In N-ENS, the modelled biomass (pre-fishery) of Snow Crab in `r year.assessment` was `r round(B_north[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_north[t1], 2)` t in `r year_previous`. In S-ENS, the `r year.assessment` modelled biomass (pre-fishery) was `r round(B_south[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_south[t1], 2)` t in `r year_previous`. In 4X, the modelled biomass (pre-fishery) for the `r year.assessment`-`r year.assessment+1` season was `r round(B_4x[t0], 2)` t, relative to `r round(B_4x[t1], 2)` t for the `r year_previous`-`r year.assessment` season. 
  

## Fishing Mortality


In N-ENS, the `r year.assessment` fishing mortality is estimated to have been `r round(FM_north[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_north[t0])-1),2)`%), up from the  `r year_previous` rate of `r round(FM_north[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_north[t1])-1),1)`%; Figure \@ref(fig:logisticFishingMortality)).

In S-ENS, the `r year.assessment` fishing mortality is estimated to have been `r round(FM_south[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_south[t0])-1),1)`%), decreasing marginally from the `r year_previous` rate of `r round(FM_south[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_south[t1])-1),1)`%; Figure \@ref(fig:logisticFishingMortality)). Localized exploitation rates are likely higher, as not all areas for which biomass is estimated are fished (e.g., continental slope areas and western, inshore areas of CFA 24).

In 4X, the `r year.assessment`-`r year.assessment+1` season (ongoing), fishing mortality is estimated to have been `r round(FM_4x[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_4x[t0])-1),1)`%), decreasing from the `r year.assessment-1`-`r year.assessment` season rate of `r round(FM_4x[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(FM_4x[t1])-1),1)`%; Figure \@ref(fig:logisticFishingMortality)). Localized exploitation rates are likely higher, as not all areas for which biomass is estimated are fished. 


## Reference Points
 
Reference points are used to guide harvest strategies (Canada Gazette 2022; DFO 2013; Figures \@ref(fig:logistic-hcr)). More specifically, the state of the fishery relative to the following "Reference Points" are assessed. In terms of modelled biomass, Lower and Upper Stock Reference are 25% and 50% of carrying capacity which delineate "critical", "cautious" and "healthy" zones. In terms of exploitation rates, the Upper Removal Reference is the exploitation rate that we try not to go beyond; it is defined in term of the fishing mortality associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY). In the biomass dynamics model, FMSY = $r /2$. As $r \approx 1$ for snow crab, FMSY $\approx 0.5$ is expected. 

The operational target exploitation changes depending upon the "zone" in which a population lands. When in the "healthy" zone, the rule of thumb has been to keep annual exploitation rates between 10% to 32% of the available biomass ($F = 0.11, 0.36$, respectively). In the "cautious" zone, the rule of thumb has been to keep annual exploitation rates between 0% to 20% ($F = 0, 0.22$, respectively). In the "critical" zone, fishery closure is considered until recovery is observed, where recovery indicates at a minimum, modelled biomass > LSR. Other biological and ecosystem considerations such as recruitment, spawning stock (female) biomass, size structure, sex ratios and environmental and ecosystem conditions, provide additional guidance within each range.

Model 1 estimates key Reference Points as shown in Table 6 and Figure \@ref(fig:ReferencePoints). The related PA thresholds can be computed as:

  - Lower Stock Reference (LSR): $K/4$
  - Upper Stock Reference (USR): $K/2$
  - Upper Removal Reference (URR): keep fishing mortality below *FMSY* = $r/2$

Model 1 suggests the current state of the fishable components to be (Figure \@ref(fig:logistic-hcr)):  

  - N-ENS is in the "healthy" zone
  - S-ENS is in the "healthy" zone
  - 4X is in the "cautious" zone

It should be emphasized that using these parameters assumes that the population dynamics are well described by the fishery model. This is, of course, **not true**. For example, the observation of fisheries landings is assumed to be known without error. This is not true as illegal and unreported exploitation occurs. These and other unaccounted factors (recruitment strength, environmental variability, predation intensity, disease) can easily bias parameter estimates. As such, **caution is required in using these reference points.** Other contextual reference points must be used in conjunction:

  - Strength of recruitment (short-term, long-term)
  - Strength of spawning stock (females)
  - Ecosystem variability (predator and prey trends and distributions) within norms
  - Habitat viability within norms
  - Availability of spatial and temporal refugia within norms 

We turn to some these additional factors in the next section.


# Ecosystem Considerations

## Bottom Temperature

Average bottom temperatures **observed** in the 2022 Snow Crab survey were near or above historical highs in all areas (Figure \@ref(fig:bottom-temperatures-survey)). A general warming trend has been observed in the Snow Crab survey since the early 1990s on the Scotian Shelf (Choi et al. 2022). Temperatures are more stable in N-ENS than S-ENS; 4X exhibits the most erratic and highest annual mean bottom temperatures. Of particular note, the observed temperatures in the 2022 Snow Crab survey for S-ENS increased well above the average. This is expected to be a source of bias and certainty for S-ENS abundance predictions as it is outside the range normally encountered by the statistical models. Furthermore, the Groundfish surveys did not operate over Snow Crab grounds in 2020 and 2022 and so temperature data is also very sparse for the area of interest.

Upon aggregation and modelling of historical temperature data, the average temperature is found to have increased well beyond the $7^\circ$C threshold in 4X. N-ENS and S-ENS also continued to experience historical highs in bottom temperature and elevated spatial variability of bottom temperatures (Figure \@ref(fig:bottom-temperatures)). In particular, the spike observed in S-ENS (above) was less extreme and so likely due to a short term influx of warm water. 

Overall, since 1999, there has been a persistent spatial gradient of almost $15^\circ$C in bottom temperatures in the Maritimes Region (Figure \@ref(fig:bottom-temperatures-spatialeffect)). This large gradient in a spatially complex and temporally dynamic area makes assessment a particular challenge for a stenothermic organism such as Snow Crab (Choi et al. 2022). 


## Viable habitat

Snow Crab being cold water stenotherms, stability of environmental conditions is critical for their survival. The Maritimes Region being at the confluence of many oceanic currents renders the area highly variable. Rapid climate change and uncertainty exacerbates this situation. The viable habitat  estimated for each area across time has shown some variations (Figures \@ref(fig:fb-habitat-timeseries), \@ref(fig:fb-habitat-map)) in the historical record. As can be seen, 4X showed a significantly lower average viable habitat levels relative to the N-ENS and S-ENS.  A peak in average probability of observing fishable snow crab ("viable habitat") was observed in 2010 for 4X, 2011 for N-ENS and 2012 for S-ENS. Since 2015, the average viable habitat has declined to historical lows and remained so in 2022. 
 

## Viable habitat in a stage-dependent model

The Model 1 representations of Snow Crab populations are imperfect at best. It is a naive phenomenological model that fits a pattern rather than biological processes (see Choi 2023). Amongst its' difficulties are:

  - Projections into the future are always optimistic as rapid growth to carrying capacity is explicitly assumed in the model structure. For example, each area is expected to increase in biomass in the absence of fishing, based upon the 1-year projection of the logistic model  (Figure \@ref(fig:logisticPredictions)). Indeed, the more that a population is depressed closer to zero, the faster this recovery is expected to be. This of course is because it ignores mechanism: the presence or absence of recruitment in any given year. It ignores the presence or absence of reproductive females for long term production. It ignores the need of a species to maintain a dominance hierarchy and that it will not be replaced by a competitor. It ignores the possibility of multiple equilibria where other ecological balances are possible.

  - Discounting/ignoring other biological processes will bias the magnitude of rate processes estimated by the model. Thus, external disturbances due to extreme weather events, dynamics of predator and prey species, disease, undocumented removals, etc., being ignored by the model will have an effect upon estimates of Reference Points. They will generally result in higher model estimates of the intrinsic rate of increase that tries to account for these additional mortality factors. FMSY and potentially carrying capacity and so biomass-based reference points will be higher as a consequence, and so result in more optimistic assessments of status than might be reasonable.

  - Currently, Model 1's status assessment of all areas seem overly optimistic. This is especially the case in 4X where we have supporting information of very high natural mortality rates associated with predation and extreme environmental variability, through the loss of strong year classes and weak recruitment into the fishery. The same issues also exist for N-ENS, where strong adolescent crab year classes seem to disappear at a rate faster that might be expected, possibly due to elevated predation mortality in the last decade. Similarly, S-ENS also has had  very strong year classes diminishing rapidly before entry into the fishable component.    

In light of these issues, we present the results of another complementary modelling approach: a *Delay Differential Stage Structured Model* (**Model 2**). The rationale for Model 2 is developed and described in detail elsewhere (Choi 2023). It is a six-component system (five male stages from instar 9 [40.9-55.1mm], 10 [55.1-74.4mm], 11 [74.4-95mm], immature [95mm+], mature [95mm+] and mature females) delay differential continuous model, where each component has a molt and/or birth from a previous stage in balance with a constant (first order) background death rate; a second-order death rate associated with varying levels of viable habitat, similar to the logistic form; and fishing mortality, assumed to be known without error. 

It must be emphasized that Model 2, though promising, is still in the *early stages of development*. Most notably, there are many more processes (parameters) being estimated; the more complex parameter space results in many local-optima. Though the use of the NUTS sampler in a Bayesian context permits some measure of robustness from becoming stuck in such local-optima, this slows down computations. Further, missing from the model are: predation mortality and movement. These latter processes will need to be parameterized for the model system to be more robust and complete. However, as it is already computationally quite expensive taking up to several days to complete one area, additional model complexity will need to be added carefully.

As Model 2 is continuous in form, we can infer greater detail with respects to the time evolution and in particular the intensity of fishing vs the usually slower recovery that depends upon recruitment levels. This creates the sawtooth pattern seen in Figure (\@ref(fig:dde-predictions-everything), orange lines). This also demonstrates why it is so difficult to model the dynamics of snow crab as temporal aliasing can be large. Even small changes in the timing of surveys or fishing can alter our understanding of the dynamics of the population. Further, the volatility of the environment in conjunction with the small population size (especially in 4X), renders a robust understanding of population dynamics a significant challenge.

Note also, the diminished overall magnitudes of the biomass (Tables 6, 7) as the relative scale of fisheries activity, variability in viable habitat, and dynamics between components informs Model 2 to more reasonable bounds. Model 2 still had difficulty tracking the fishable biomass index in N-ENS (2016 to present), S-ENS (all years) and 4X (2016-2022). There are other factors that are not captured by the model and/or the data. We hypothesize that one such process is subarea dynamics with sub-legal components that are out of phase and internal structure (inshore-offshore and southwest-northeast decoherence) causing an overall dampening effect. Predation and movement are the missing processes. But the survey itself taking up to 4 months to complete, can be seen to be problematic as well, in that temporal and spatial aliasing is introduced.

Fishing mortality estimates from Model 2 (Figure \@ref(fig:dde-fishing-mortality)) have an overall form that is similar to those of Model 1 (Figure \@ref(fig:logisticFishingMortality)). As with Model 1, Model 2 suggests peak fishing mortality likely occurred in N-ENS in 2005 and earlier. After strong and difficult reductions, it has slowly increased over time. In S-ENS, it has been more stable and conservative throughout the timeseries. In 4X, prior to formal assessments beginning in 2005, fishing mortality was likely to have been high, but has since declined to a range consistent with the other regions. 

The important difference between the two models is that Model 2 suggests fishing mortality rates are higher in magnitude than those of Model 1. Model 2 estimates of fishing mortality rate for N-ENS in the `r year.assessment` was `r round(ddeFM_north[t0],2)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_north[t0])-1),2)`%), up from the `r year_previous` rate of `r round(ddeFM_north[t1],1)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_north[t1])-1),1)`%). In S-ENS, the `r year.assessment` fishing mortality was `r round(ddeFM_south[t0],2)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_south[t0])-1),1)`%), down slightly from the `r year_previous` rate of `r round(ddeFM_south[t1],2)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_south[t1])-1),1)`%). In 4X, the `r year.assessment`-`r year.assessment+1` season (ongoing) fishing mortality was `r round(ddeFM_4x[t0],2)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_4x[t0])-1),1)`%), down from the `r year_previous`-`r year.assessment` season rate of `r round(ddeFM_4x[t1],2)` (annual exploitation rate of `r round(100*(exp(ddeFM_4x[t1])-1),1)`%). 

There is no concept of FMSY in Model 2 as there is no stable solution to such an externally perturbed system (viable habitat). One can, however, accept Model 1's assertion that FMSY should be somewhere close to 0.5. Using this an approximate landmark, N-ENS may have come close to this threshold in 2022. The trajectory of stock status (Figure \@ref(fig:dde-hcr)), would suggest that all areas are in "healthy" states, though 4X is very close to the border of the "cautious" zone. The important difference in interpretation is that carrying capacity estimates may be generally lower. In particular, for S-ENS, dynamics may have been moving quite close to carrying capacity levels and sometimes even surpassing it when good environmental conditions are followed rapidly by average conditions. Overall, reality is likely somewhere in between the two Models inferences.
 
Further, assuming there is *no fishing* in the next year, there is a prediction of increased abundance for N-ENS and S-ENS and a *decrease* in abundance in 4X (Figure (\@ref(fig:dde-predictions-everything)), orange lines after 2022 converge towards the green). In contrast, Model 1 will *always* project an increase due to its naive assumptions (\@ref(fig:logisticPredictions)).  

An alternative, and perhaps more intuitive index of fishing effect is to express it not in terms of an instantaneous rate nor interval approximations which are bound to parameters that can be biased (such as K, r, FMSY), but rather, how much fishing has moved the dynamics of a population away from what it may have been if there had been no fishing. This **fishery footprint** (Figure \@ref(fig:dde-footprint-trace)) represented by the degree of divergence between the orange lines (with fishing) and the green lines (no fishing). This fishery footprint has been about 25% to 50% in N-ENS since 2010. In S-ENS, the fisheries footprint has been stable and low between 10% to 30%. Area 4X fisheries footprint has declined from over 50% in the pre-2010 period to now a value of less than 25%. This suggests fisheries exploitation in 2022 was reasonably precautionary, with the exception of N-ENS.  
 
By assuming that:

  - The posterior distributions of these parameters are robust
  - Fishing pattern across time will be similar to the past five years
  - Average size of the fishable component will be similar
  - Habitat viability will be similar to the current year
  - Predation and prey conditions will be similar

we can project slightly more mechanistic expectations of future time trends for the fishable component (Figure \@ref(fig:projections-fb)) for varying levels of catch.  All scenarios considered (80%, 100% and 120% of `r year.assessment`'s TACs) lead to declining trends in the fishable biomass, with steeper declines with higher harvest scenarios.  

Exact probabilities could also be computed from the posterior distributions, but the approach would have a high risk of failure due to the large number of assumptions. Rather than presuming that we have captured the true dynamics and the associated uncertainties, we instead, focus upon the effects of harvest scenarios upon the fishery footprint, which is more robust to errors of parameterizations as it is internally coherent and so perhaps a more utilitarian device to assess sub-component dynamics and integrate them to judge the directionality the fishery at different levels of exploitation (fishery footprint; Figure \@ref(fig:projections-footprint)).

These results from Model 2 are supplementary in nature to provide additional context. Their direct use in defining reference point thresholds is **not recommended** at this point. 


## Predators, preys, competitors

Being long-lived, the influence of predators can be significant. Especially important are predators of the smaller immature and female Snow Crab. Increasing predation not only lowers the abundance and recruitment, it can also reduce the reproductive potential of Snow Crab and therefore long-term population cycles. N-ENS and S-ENS are well known to have skewed sex ratios with few mature females for extended periods of time, quite possibly linked to differential predation mortality (mature females being much smaller and full of fat-rich gonads and eggs). 

Based on stomach sampling, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Wolffish, Thorny Skate, and other skate species are known predators of Snow Crab. Large Atlantic Halibut with mature female Snow Crab in their stomachs have been reported. Anecdotal information of some seals having fed upon Snow Crab are also known. 

Some of these predators (e.g., Halibut; DFO 2018) have significantly increased in abundance in the Region. However, for all, the abundance and encounter rates in areas overlapping with snow crab habitat is more important, but this is not known. We do know from the bycatch in the Snow Crab survey that there are elevated areal **densities** with many snow crab trawl samples. This means that encounter rates will also likely increase and so too potentially predation mortality. However, high density does not equate to high abundance nor high total predation mortality; but this remains unknown and requires further analysis. The following presents information of areal density of co-occuring species; they are potential predators, competitors and prey. 

Atlantic Halibut densities have increased rapidly since 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:halibut-timeseries); DFO 2018) on Snow Crab grounds. Most of these increases were towards The Gully, Slope Edge and near Sable Island (\@ref(fig:halibut-map)).

Thorny skate densities have been increasing as well (Figure \@ref(fig:thornyskate-timeseries)), especially in N-ENS and along the margins of Banquereau Bank (Figure \@ref(fig:thornyskate-map)). A minor decline in the densities have been seen in 4X.

Striped Atlantic Wolffish densities have been high, though declining in N-ENS since 2007 (Figure \@ref(fig:Wolffish-timeseries)). Highest densities were towards the Laurentian Channel (Figure \@ref(fig:Wolffish-map)).

Northern shrimp co-occur as they share similar habitat preferences and are also potential prey items of Snow Crab. Their numerical densities have declined after a peak in 2011, especially in S-ENS (Figures \@ref(fig:Shrimp-timeseries), \@ref(fig:Shrimp-map)). 

Lesser toad crab is a co-occurring species and potential competitor. Their numbers have declined to low levels throughout, after a peak in densities in 2007 and 2016 in N-ENS (Figures \@ref(fig:lessertoadcrab-timeseries), \@ref(fig:lessertoadcrab-map)).

Overall, higher predation mortality seems likely in N- and S-ENS and lower in 4X. Further shrimp with similar habitat preferences have declined, possibly due to large-scaled habitat variations and predation.


## Other sources of uncertainty
 
* Bycatch of other species in the Snow Crab fishery cannot be reliably computed as they are derived from At-Sea-Observed data. 

* Bycatch of Snow Crab in other fisheries remains an area requiring attention. Anecdotal information from fishers suggest illegal retention of sublegal and female Snow Crab as bycatch and their use as bait. Illegal removals are also known to occur; however, the scale of such activities are not known.

* Oil and gas exploration (especially the use of seismics), development and exploitation (pollution) continues to be issues as their long-term effects remain unknown, though they are known to be generally deleterious to most life.

* Undersea, high-voltage cables is another source of concern. Many marine organisms are known to be sensitive to electromagnetic fields: fish in particular through their lateral line canals use it to detect prey. As such, predators and prey distributions can be affected causing indirect effects upon Snow Crab. Direct effects are also possible through trenching, but long term effects remain unknown.  

* Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) continue to be developed (e.g., Canada Gazette 2016). The presence of a refuge from fishing activities is potentially positive for Snow Crab. However, positive effects upon other organisms (predators or prey) can have counter-balancing effects. The overall long-term effects of the MPAs upon Snow Crab are unknown.

* Capture of soft-shell Snow Crab is always a concern. Prompt and careful return of immature (small-clawed, non-terminally molted) crab to the water is an important conservation measure that will enhance the 2-3 year productivity of the fishable component.

* Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing activities are known to occur. Such activities hinder the application of a precautionary approach to the management of this resource and cause potential bias and uncertainty in Reference Point estimation.

All of the above uncertainties are human induced and unlike the larger scaled climatic and ecosystemic uncertainties, there is some measure of human intervention possible. To remain adaptive in the face of these and other as yet unknown uncertainties including the climatic and ecosystemic uncertainties of which we are already aware, is the true challenge. It requires a balance of both resilience and robustness (see, Choi and Patten 2001). The Precautionary Approach as practiced by the snow crab fishers in Maritimes Region represents a unique model of such an adaptive approach. It values qualitity information and the communication and discussion of approaches in a distributed, collective information network that goes well beyond the simplistic and potentially maladaptive rubric of a purely "reference-points" based approach. Continued vigilence is necessary.


# CONCLUSIONS  

The ESS ecosystem is still experiencing a lot of volatility driven by rapid ecosystem and climatic variations. Under such conditions, it is prudent to be careful. Further, the overall indications of population status suggest that Snow Crab are still able to persist under extreme conditions if they are episodic, albeit, with some shifts in spatial distribution towards cooler and deeper waters. 

The modelled solutions represent a few of many possible views of the dynamics of snow crab. Over-emphasis of any one of these modelled solutions and associated Reference Points in determining a strategy for fisheries management is **not prudent** and certainly not precautionary. 


- In N-ENS, though recruitment continues at low levels, a gap in future recruitment to the fishery is expected for the next 1-3 years in N-ENS. N-ENS still exists in the healthy zone and so still has flexibility in approach. However, fishing mortality may have been higher than desirable. A more conservative harvest strategy would enable bridging this coming recruitment gap. A reduced TAC is prudent. 

- In S-ENS, recruitment to the fishery is likely to continue at a moderate rate for the upcoming season. The S-ENS stock remains in the healthy zone. Exploitation rates derived from the fishery model have been declining in recent years. S-ENS has considerable flexibility in approach. All TAC directions are viable. 

- In 4X, low to moderate levels of recruitment are expected for 2 years. 4X exists in the "cautious zone". The area is also in the southern-most extent of Snow Crab distribution in the North Atlantic and viable habitat has been depressed for many years. A reduced TAC is prudent.
