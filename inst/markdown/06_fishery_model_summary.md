N-ENS: `{r} round(FM_north[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_north[t0])-1),2)`%) in `{r} year_assessment`

  - Up from the  `{r} year_previous` rate of `{r} round(FM_north[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_north[t1])-1),1)`%)

S-ENS: `{r} round(FM_south[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_south[t0])-1),1)`%) in `{r} year_assessment`

  - Decreasing marginally from the `{r} year_previous` rate of `{r} round(FM_south[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_south[t1])-1),1)`%)

4X: `{r} round(FM_4x[t0],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_4x[t0])-1),1)`%) in `{r} year_assessment`-`{r} year_assessment+1` season

  - Decreasing from the `{r} year_assessment-1`-`{r} year_assessment` season rate of `{r} round(FM_4x[t1],3)` (annual exploitation rate of `{r} round(100*(exp(FM_4x[t1])-1),1)`%)

Localized exploitation rates are likely higher, as not all areas for which biomass is estimated are fished.

- N-ENS is in the "cautious" zone
- S-ENS is in the "healthy" zone
- 4X is in the "critical" zone



# Conclusions

The ESS ecosystem is still experiencing a lot of volatility and prudence is wise:

- Rapid ecosystem change (groundfish collapse in 1980s and 1990s)
- Rapid climatic change: variability high, very warm period from 2012-2024
- Snow crab:
  - Can persist if extreme conditions are episodic by shifting spatial distributions
  - 4X was possibly too long and did not have the habitat space
  - Climate variability can induce juxtaposition of warmer water species (prey and predators) with snow crab
  - Some shifts in spatial distribution towards cooler and deeper waters

Modelled solutions:

- A few of many possible views
- Over-emphasis of any one view and associated Reference Points is **not precautionary**.


## Conclusions: N-ENS

- Viable habitat stable near historical mean and marginally improved relative to 2022.
- Female larval production peaked in 2017 and has since declined.
- Recruitment continues at low levels, a noticible gap in recruitment to the fishery persists.
- Predation mortality (Cod, Halibut, Skate) is likely high and causing reduced recruitment to the fishery.
- Fishing mortality has been increasing since 2019.
- Fishable biomass continues a decreasing trend.
- PA template suggest "healthy zone".
- A more careful harvest strategy would enable bridging this coming recruitment gap.
- A reduced TAC is prudent.

In N-ENS, though recruitment continues at low levels,
a gap in future recruitment to the fishery is expected for the next 1-3 years


 bridging this coming recruitment gap. A reduced TAC is prudent.


## Conclusions: S-ENS

- Viable habitat marginally improved relative to a historic low in 2022.
- Female larval production peaked in 2023/2024.
- Recruitment to the fishery from a strong year class has begun, full entry by 2025.
- Predation mortality (Halibut, Plaice, Sculpin, Skate) is likely high and causing reduced recruitment to the fishery.
- Fishing mortality has been increasing since 2019.
- Fishable biomass is at a historical low.
- PA template suggest "healthy zone".

- Flexiblity in harvest strategy exists due to strong recuitment.
- A status quo TAC is prudent until confirmation of recruitment.

recruitment to the fishery is likely to continue at a moderate rate for the upcoming season


## Conclusions: 4X

- Viable habitat has been at historical lows since 2015.
- Female larval production peaked in 2022.
- Recruitment to the fishery in the near-term is not evident. There is a pulse 4-5 years away.
- Predation mortality (Halibut) and competition with other Crustacea is likely high and causing reduced recruitment to the fishery.
- Fishing mortality has declined to negligible levels since a peak in 2019.
- Fishable biomass is at a historical low.
- PA template suggest "critical zone".
- Stock status is extremely poor.
- Fishery closure until recovery is prudent.

   low to moderate levels of recruitment are expected for 2 years.
   4X exists in the "cautious zone".

   habitat has been depressed for many years. A reduced TAC is prudent.
