Follow the numerical sequence in running the scripts:

- 0X.*   : core assessment (required)

- 1X.*   : assessment presentations, miscellaneous docs, reports, etc (see note below)

- 99*  : deprecated or testing scripts.


See also [inst/markdown](inst/markdown) for reports. Many of these R-files are actually markdown documents that have been cross-linked such that they can become Rmarkdown or Quarto documents which can render to PDF or HTML. See the file: [inst/markdown/Makefile](inst/markdown/Makefile). It provides simple recipes for generating these reports using gnu-make. OR use vscode or r-studio to render them internally (but that requires you configure them appropriately -- this is a moving target so check current online resources).
