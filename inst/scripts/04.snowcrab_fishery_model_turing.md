# Dynamical Fishery Model 

## Purpose

Prepare aggregated time-series data for inference using a Bayesian fishery model. Currently, the default model is the discrete logistic formulation. It is labelled, "logistic_historical" in the following. There are other variations possible. See the calling code.

## Prepare data for discrete logistic models

This step requires 03.biomass_index_carstm.r to be completed as it statistically models the survey samples in space and time and then aggregates across space. 


```r
# R-code
source( file.path( code_root, "bio_startup.R" )  )
loadfunctions("bio.snowcrab")
year.assessment = 2022  # <<< change this as required

# assemble the required data for each region and save it.
fishery_model_data_inputs( year.assessment=year.assessment, type="biomass_dynamics", for_julia=TRUE )
```

## Model fitting and parameter inference

Now that data inputs are complete, we can continue on to model fitting and inference. This is done in (Julia)[https://julialang.org/]. 

This requires [https://github.com/jae0/dynamical_model](https://github.com/jae0/dynamical_model). 

Install or download it and then run the following:

(Alternatively, you can run directly from [https://github.com/jae0/dynamical_model/blob/master/snowcrab/04.snowcrab_fishery_model.md](https://github.com/jae0/dynamical_model/blob/master/snowcrab/04.snowcrab_fishery_model.md), where more options are shown.)



```julia
# Julia-code follows:

## change these to the right year and location:
year_assessment = <current year>  

# location of dynamical_model
project_directory = joinpath( homedir(), "bio", "dynamical_model", "snowcrab" ) 

# location of data
bio_data_directory = joinpath( homedir(), "bio.data" )  
outputs_directory  = joinpath( homedir(), "bio.data", "bio.snowcrab", "fishery_model" ) 

runtype = "operational"
model_variation = "logistic_discrete_historical"  # pre-2022 method 

# choose a region of interest:
aulab = "cfanorth"
aulab = "cfasouth"
aulab = "cfa4x"

include( joinpath(project_directory, "snowcrab_startup.jl" ) )  # add some paths and package requirements

Random.seed!(year_assessment);

res  =  sample( fmod, turing_sampler, MCMCThreads(), n_samples, n_chains ) # sample in parallel 

# if threading is not working (MSWindows?) try:
# res = mapreduce(c -> sample(fmod, turing_sampler, n_samples), chainscat, 1:n_chains)

@save res_fn res

```

Now that results have been generated and saved, we can continue with a few computations and predictions.

## Predictions and figures


```julia
# n scaled, n unscaled, biomass of fb with and without fishing, model_traces, model_times 
m, num, bio, trace, trace_bio, trace_time = fishery_model_predictions(res ) 

# fishing (kt), relative Fishing mortality, instantaneous fishing mortality:
Fkt, FR, FM = fishery_model_mortality() 

# save a few data files as semicolon-delimited CSV's for use outside Julia
summary_fn = joinpath( model_outdir, string("results_turing", "_", aulab, "_summary", ".csv" ) )  
CSV.write( summary_fn,  summarize( res ), delim=";" )  # use semicolon as , also used in parm names
  
bio_fn1 = joinpath( model_outdir, string("results_turing", "_", aulab, "_bio_fishing", ".csv" ) )  
CSV.write( bio_fn1,  DataFrame(bio[:,:], :auto), delim=";" )  # use semicolon as , also used in parm names

fm_fn = joinpath( model_outdir, string("results_turing", "_", aulab, "_fm", ".csv" ) )  
CSV.write( fm_fn,  DataFrame( FM, :auto), delim=";" )  # use semicolon as , also used in parm names


# annual snapshots of biomass (kt) 
pl = fishery_model_plot( toplot=("survey", "fishing" ) )
savefig(pl, joinpath( model_outdir, string("plot_predictions_", aulab, ".pdf") )  )

# plot fishing mortality, , 
pl = fishery_model_plot( toplot="fishing_mortality" )
# pl = plot(pl, ylim=(0, 0.65))
savefig(pl, joinpath( model_outdir, string("plot_fishing_mortality_", aulab, ".pdf") )  )

# HCR plot
pl = fishery_model_plot( toplot="harvest_control_rule", n_sample=1000 ) #, alphav=0.01 )  # hcr
# pl = plot(pl, ylim=(0, 0.65))
savefig(pl, joinpath( model_outdir, string("plot_hcr_", aulab, ".pdf") )  )


```

And that is it. Continue with report generation either through [Markdown](./10.snowcrab_r_markdown_documents.md) or a word processor.
