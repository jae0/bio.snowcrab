# Dynamical Fishery Model 

## Purpose

Prepare aggregated time-series data for inference using a Bayesian fishery model. Currently, the default model is the discrete logistic formulation. It is labelled, "logistic_historical" in the following. There are other variations possible. See the calling code.

## Prepare data for discrete logistic models

This step requires 03.biomass_index_carstm.r to be completed as it statistically models the survey samples in space and time and then aggregates across space for a less biased estimate/index of abundance. 

  [bio.snowcrab/inst/scripts/03.biomass_index_carstm.r](bio.snowcrab/inst/scripts/03.biomass_index_carstm.r)  

Make sure to have run at the very bottom of the file:

```R
## note the output directory .. this location is used below
fishery_model_data_inputs( year.assessment=year.assessment,  type="biomass_dynamics", for_julia=TRUE ) 
```

## Model fitting and parameter inference

Now that data inputs are complete, we can continue on to model fitting and inference. This is done in (Julia)[https://julialang.org/]. 

First install or download Julia and install appropriate libraries from withing Julia. 

There are two ways you can use this. 

  1. Run within Julia directly.

    This method is most flexible and [documented here](https://github.com/jae0/dynamical_model/blob/master/snowcrab/04.snowcrab_fishery_model.md), where more options are also shown.  

  2. Run within R and indirectly call Julia, using the JuliaCall R-library (install that too).

    This method is shown below.


```R
 
  year.assessment = 2023

  p = bio.snowcrab::load.environment( year.assessment=year.assessment )

  # location of data and outputs
  outputs_directory = file.path(data_root, "bio.snowcrab", "fishery_model" )
  model_outdir = file.path( outputs_directory, year.assessment, "logistic_discrete_historical" )
  work_dir = file.path( work_root, "fishery_model" )
  
  dir.create( outputs_directory, recursive=TRUE )
  dir.create( model_outdir, recursive=TRUE )
  dir.create( work_dir, recursive=TRUE)

  # copy julia scripts to a temp location where julia can write to (R-library is usually write protected)
  julia_scripts_location = system.file( "julia", package="bio.snowcrab" )
  file.copy( file.path(julia_scripts_location, "snowcrab_startup.jl"), work_dir, overwrite=TRUE  )
  file.copy( file.path(julia_scripts_location, "logistic_discrete_functions.jl"), work_dir, overwrite=TRUE )
  file.copy( file.path(julia_scripts_location, "logistic_discrete.jl"), work_dir, overwrite=TRUE )


  # this needs to be the same as that produced above (fishery_model_data_inputs)
  fndat  = file.path( data_root, "bio.snowcrab", "modelled", "1999_present_fb", "fishery_model_results", "turing1", "biodyn_biomass.RData" )


  if (0) {
      # to set up:
      # julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary")
      # options(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary")
      # Set JULIA_HOME in command line environment.
      install.packages("JuliaCall")
      install_julia()
  }

  # load JuliaCall interface
  library(JuliaCall)
  julia <- julia_setup()

  ## transfer params to julia environment
  julia_assign( "year_assessment", year.assessment )  # copy data into julia session
  julia_assign( "bio_data_directory", data_root) 
  julia_assign( "outputs_directory", outputs_directory )  # copy data into julia session
  julia_assign( "model_outdir", model_outdir )  # copy data into julia session


  # julia_source cannot traverse directories .. temporarily switch directory

  currentwd = getwd() 
   
  setwd(work_dir) 

    # load/install libraries and setup directories 
    # .. if not all libraries are installed, you might need to re-run this a few more times
    julia_source( "snowcrab_startup.jl" )  
    
    # load core modelling functions
    julia_source( "logistic_discrete_functions.jl" )  

    # load data; alter file path as required
    julia_assign( "fndat", fndat )  # load data into julia session
    julia_command("o = load( fndat, convert=true) ")
 
    # Model and compute predictions for each area
    julia_command( "Random.seed!(1234)" )

    # modelling and outputs for each region 
    julia_assign( "yrs", p$yrs )   

    # cfanorth:    
    julia_assign( "aulab", "cfanorth" )   
    julia_source( "logistic_discrete.jl" )   

    # cfasouth:    
    julia_assign( "aulab", "cfasouth")  # copy data into julia session
    julia_source( "logistic_discrete.jl" )   # modelling and outputs

    # cfa4x:    
    julia_assign( "aulab", "cfa4x" )  # copy data into julia session
    julia_source( "logistic_discrete.jl" )   # modelling and outputs

  setwd(currentwd) # revert work directory

  # Example:
  # to move data into R
  # objects that might be useful:  m, num, bio, trace, Fkt, FR, FM 
  # bio = julia_eval("bio")  
```

 

And that is it. Continue with report generation either through [Markdown](./10.snowcrab_r_markdown_documents.md).
