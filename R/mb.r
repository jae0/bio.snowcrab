    mb = function(i) exp(1.917564 + 0.298914*i)
    # mb = male bound in cw where i=1 when cw = ~ 9.2 mm,
    # instar 5 is bounded by mb(2) and mb(3)
    # prior to instar 5 moulting can be variable and so should not be
    # relied upon to heavily
    #  see "model.size.structure.r" for details of derivation
