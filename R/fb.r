   fb = function(i) exp(2.198848 + 0.315026*i)
    # fb = female bound in cw where i=1 when cw = ~ 12.5 mm,
    # instar 5 is bounded by fb(1) and fb(2)
    # prior to instar 5 moulting can be variable and so should not be
    # relied upon to heavily
    #  see "model.size.structure.r" for details of derivation
