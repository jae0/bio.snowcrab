# R functions

Collection of various R-functions used for snow crab stock assessment in the Maritimes Region of Canada. They are here for the purposes of transparency and reproducibility. The code can also be used for other fisheries to generate data structures and so use the same/similar methods. 

They are here for posterity.

Most are error-checked but if ever you encounter errors, or use it for your own work, please notify us.
